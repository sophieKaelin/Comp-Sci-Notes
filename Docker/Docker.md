# Docker

*Less security focused, more just some information on Docker for context*
*Based primarily off Udemy course "Docker Master: with Kubernetes + Swarm from a Docker Captain"*

## Intro

### Why Docker?
* Speed is improved.
* Consistency and centrality.
* Software requires maintainence, so much software.
    * Docker frees up time.
* Yes less operating systems to run everything -> infrastructure savings
* Largely open source
* landscape.cncf.io

### Which version do I use?
* store.docker.com
* 3 major types of installing: Direct, Mac/Win, Cloud
* Differences between CE vs EE
    * CE is Community Edition, EE is Enterprise Edition (paid)
* Edge = beta (only supported for a month until the next beta is out)
* Stable = comes out once a quarter, and is supported for 4 months (1 month buffer for support for you to move onto next version)
